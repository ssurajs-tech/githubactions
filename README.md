GitHub Actions

Automation is important in software development to reduce manual effort, improve efficiency, and streamline workflows. GitHub Actions is a built-in CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) tool in GitHub that allows developers to automate tasks such as building, testing, and deploying applications.

In this article, we will learn how to use GitHub Actions, from understanding its core components to creating your first workflow and optimizing it for maximum efficiency.

What are GitHub Actions?
GitHub Actions is a powerful automation tool built directly into GitHub, allowing developers to automate, customize, and run workflows directly from their repositories. By using GitHub Actions, we can automate processes such as continuous integration, continuous deployment, testing, and code reviews.

Unlike traditional CI/CD tools, GitHub Actions is event-driven, meaning it can be triggered by various GitHub events like code commits, pull requests, issue creation, and more.
